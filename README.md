I code daily and keep myself updated with the most important news in the programming world. As a professional, I use PHP in my daily work and am constantly improving my skills in this language. Also, I like working with TypeScript and languages that allow me to apply Object Oriented Programming.

The most important thing about me: everything I do is driven by aesthetics. I write short stories, poems and codes guided by this principle.

Take a look at the things I'm doing here:

- [bookeeper](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/bookeeper): Web application for personal library management. This project is under development.
- [querier-ts](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/querier-ts): Node.js package that allows you to create queries for JS objects using TS tools. Feel free to contribute to this project.
