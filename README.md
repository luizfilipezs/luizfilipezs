# Hello World!

I am diary coding and keeping myself up to date with the most important news in the programming world. I as professional, I use PHP in my daily work and I am constantly improving my skills on this language. Also, I like working with TypeScript and languages that allow me to apply Object Oriented Programming.

The most important thing about me: everything I do is moved by the aesthetic. I write tales, poems, and code guided by that principle.

Take a look at the things I'm doing here:

- [bookeeper](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/bookeeper): Web application for personal library management. This project is under development.
- [querier-ts](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/querier-ts): Node.js package that allows you to create queries for JS objects using TS tools. Feel free to contribute on this project.
