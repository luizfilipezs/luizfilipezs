# Hello World!

I love coding and designing applications, improving my knowledge, and challenging myself. I'm currently learning how to use JavaScript as a backend language, but I admit that I can't hide my love for Python (:see_no_evil::heart:). I'm also trying to become a professional C# developer and to improve my ability on creating more secure applications.

My main repositories here are:

- [http-service-ts](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/http-service-ts)
- [lets-debug](https://github.com/luizfilipezs/lets-debug)

The first one is a package written in TypeScript. It allows you to make requests to server and parse them handling a single `Promise`.

`lets-debug` is a Python package that you can use to debug your applications using terminal or cmd.

I hope you like my work here and I invite you to visit [my blog](https://blogdolipe.com.br), where I weekly post articles from developer to developer :wink:

See the latest articles I wrote:

Now, I have to go and code something... :octocat:
